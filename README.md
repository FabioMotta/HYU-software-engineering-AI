## Abstract
During the second semester at Hanyang
University, we were asked to make a project that involved both
Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. Our team
decided to make a game, and we chose to implement "4 wins"
(also known as "Connect Four"). This game is a turn-based
game, which involves two players trying to connect four of their
checkers in a row while preventing their opponent (the other
player) from doing the same. This game will be playable through
a web interface, and the outcomes will be saved on the server.
Thus, we will be able to feed the AI with every game played
before. Players will then be able to face the AI in the game.

## Introduction
Everyone had this experience in their lifetime. Either you
had a bet with your brother to get the bigger room or to win a
bet against a friend. Normally these bets are fought with
games. Card games, Chess or other games like Connect Four.
In life sometimes it’s crucial to win such a bet. But stay close,
you don’t have to worry anymore about losing important
games with our Software. Using new technologies such as
Artificial Intelligence we create an app that gives you at any
moment the winning steps. Connect 4I does not only know
long-known moves but also finds new moves as the software
is trained with each game. To reach this goal, we use already
established algorithms and make them better. We will not
only provide you with a tool to win a bet but also make it to
you possible to reach your desires and dreams.

## Status
See the documentation to see the requirements of this project.
### Working
- Start a game
- Load old game
- Play against the AI

### Next possible feature implementation
- Improve AI
- Improve documentation
  - Add a system sequence diagram
- Undo move
- Set difficulty

## Starting up the project (only DEV)
This project can only be used in development mode. (It is not production ready in terms of configuration reasons)
You will find in the corresponding repository how the software was built (Diagrams, ...)
